## WeatherPy -Determining the Ideal City
In this Python API exercise I have analyzed ideal weather conditions of cities in the latitudes and longitudes near the equator. The OpenWeatherMap API was used to retrieve cities using lat, long. The cities with ideal temperature above 70 and under 80 with wind speed of less than 10mph with cloudiness 0 were derived for a perfect vacation! The Latitudes of these cities were compares to the temperature, humidity, cloudiness and the wind speed.

# VacationPy - Finding hotels for your vacation
The ideal cities from WeatherPy was saved into an output file which we used in VacationPy to find good hotels within 5000 miles of that lat long. This was achieved using the googlemaps API with nearby search. We then used this data to generate the heatmap and marker layer of the places using gmaps module.
